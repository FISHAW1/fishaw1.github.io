Story
<br>
<br>
<br>
The first issue I worked on was the first version of the dev info page, for this I had to come up with what information was needed and figure out what information people were willing to give. After 3 different tries what I ended up using was just name, email and picture (https://github.com/SoftEnOP/semester-tracker-team-rocket/issues/10 links to where people gave that info), during this a lot of the work was just talking to the rest of the team so I could figure out what information each person was willing to have about them put on the site, initially I tried for more basing what I was making off of some examples but because most people where not willing to have lots of the info put on the site I had to cut what I put down to the most basics and even then it was hard to get everyone to agree to have their email to be put on the site. If I was to change anything about how I did this I would change the way I decided on what information to use from what everyone could agree on to a majority vote, this would of allowed for more information while still being fair to everyone involved. As this was a first version I had to make sure to design this page in a way that was easy to come back to and edit later to do this I made sure that more information could be added to each person later and that no one’s info was locked in place in any way.
<br>
<br>
The second issue I worked on was the ability to show/hide days of the week, for this I had to use the page someone else was working on as a base so I would not have to redo the days he had put in, a issue came out of this when the we found that the ids for some objects were not set correctly and I had to change most of the page to get this to work, after I had changed the page by grouping each day into its own table it then became possible to hide one or more days by hiding its table. After finishing that page we changed the main page to the page I had just finished, after showing this to the client they wanted to have some things changed (add a week number, remove the lecture column and remove a gap that was between tables), so I spent the rest of that sprint changing that and fixing some other minor problems with the tables (there was a day repeated in one). (link to the old home pages code https://github.com/SoftEnOP/semester-tracker-team-rocket/blob/master/gh-pages/Before/index.html, link to old page http://mariadb.ict.op.ac.nz/~se18s2_04/semester-tracker-team-rocket/gh-pages/, link to the issue ticket https://github.com/SoftEnOP/semester-tracker-team-rocket/issues/11)
<br>
<br>
During the sprint 3 we were moving the site to Laravel, only one person had to work on this so the rest of us just helped if asked and I checked over the site for any big issues. (site commits https://github.com/SoftEnOP/semester-tracker-team-rocket/graphs/contributors?from=2018-07-15&to=2018-11-23&type=c )
<br>
<br>
During the fourth sprint I initially worked on issue 32 which was to hide days/weeks/classes on the new site but after finding how to do this then going to work on it I realised I had to wait for the database and semester adder parts of the site to be finished, after talking to the rest of the group it was decided to have me check for any mistakes/issues on the site I could find and fix what I could. During the sprint one of the thing I worked on was to add a link  to the site readme, https://github.com/SoftEnOP/semester-tracker-team-rocket/issues/28 links to the issue ticket.
<br>
<br>
For sprint five because the semester adder still wasn’t finished I started work on the dev info page again, for this I first had to fix some issues that had come about of moving it to the new site (https://github.com/SoftEnOP/semester-tracker-team-rocket/blob/master/resources/views/devinfo.blade.php links to the pages code), the main issue was that the pictures no longer displayed so I had to find the link to the picture  on the old site to use instead of a direct link to the picture in its folder, after doing this I then convinced the team to let me add some more information to the dev info page, after talk about it with them for a while we decided to add a bio to the page, after testing where to put the bios it was decided to have them site next to each person’s picture so it was easy to tell which bio belonged to which person, the rest of the sprint was spent waiting on each person to had in a bio and reading over everyone’s to make sure the was no spelling mistakes or any other problems by the end of the sprint most had handed in their bio. Because some people had not handed in their bio by the end of the sprint I had to contact them and get them to hand one in, this was first done though the groups chat and the issue tickets comments (https://github.com/orgs/SoftEnOP/teams/team-rocket, https://github.com/SoftEnOP/semester-tracker-team-rocket/issues/10 ) but because one person did not reply I had to go and fiscally track them down and ask for them to had one in, though they still did not by the end of the last sprint.
<br>
<br>
One major thing that I could of done to improve in was how I communicated with the team, this was because of some minor delays that could have been avoided if I had chosen a different way to try communicating with the team at first an example of this was how during the last sprint I could have had everyone’s bios faster if I had gone and found them and asked for one as well as putting up the notification on the groups chat at first instead of just the chat, this could of let me get some more work done as well as get the work I was doing done faster.
